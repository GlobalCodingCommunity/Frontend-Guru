# Users Database

## Description

Build a UI that shows a list of users within a database (client-side) and contains the following elements and behaviors:

## Requirements

- **User List**: The listbox shows a list of all users in the database. At most one entry can be selected at a time.

- **Search Functionality**: By entering a string into the "Search" input, users containing the string will be filtered. The filtering happens immediately without submission / pressing Enter.

- **Create Button**:
  - Only enabled when no users are selected and when both name fields are filled.
  - Upon activation, a new user is created based on the name input fields and added to the database. The input fields are then cleared.

- **Update Button**:
  - Only enabled when there is a user selected.
  - Upon activation, the selected user's name is updated in the database.

- **Delete Button**:
  - Only enabled when there is a user selected.
  - Upon activation, the selected user is removed from the database.

- **Cancel Button**:
  - Only enabled when there is a user selected.
  - Upon activation, any selected user and both name input fields are cleared.
