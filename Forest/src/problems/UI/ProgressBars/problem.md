# Progress Bars Challenge

Build an interactive app where clicking the "Add" button dynamically adds progress bars to the page. Each progress bar should fill up gradually as soon as it's displayed.

## Requirements

- **Add Functionality**: Clicking the "Add" button adds a new progress bar to the page
- **Smooth Animation**: Each progress bar starts filling up smoothly immediately upon being added
- **Animation Duration**: Each bar takes approximately **2000ms** to completely fill up
- **Multiple Bars**: Support adding multiple progress bars that animate independently

## Implementation Notes

- Progress bars should animate from 0% to 100% 
- Animation should be smooth and consistent across all bars
- Each new bar should start its animation immediately when added
