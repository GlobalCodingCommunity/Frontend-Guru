# Progress Bars 2

## Description

> **Note:** This is an advanced version of Progress Bars. You should complete that question first before attempting this one.

Build an app where clicking the "Add" button adds progress bars to the page. The progress bars fill up in seriesâ€”the second bar only starts filling up after the first bar is completely filled.

## Requirements

- Clicking on the "Add" button adds a progress bar to the page
- The progress bars fill up gradually in sequence, one at a time (the second progress bar only starts filling up after the first progress bar is completely filled)
- Each bar takes approximately 2000ms to completely fill up
