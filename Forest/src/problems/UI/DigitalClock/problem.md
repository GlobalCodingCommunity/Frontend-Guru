# Digital Clock Component

## Objective

Create a widget that renders the current time in **HH:MM:SS** format using a 7-segment digital display. You are free to choose to use either a 12-hour or 24-hour display format.

## Requirements

- Display current time with hours, minutes, and seconds
- Use a 7-segment digital display style
- Update in real-time (every second)
- Each digit should be rendered using individual segments

## Design Guidelines

You can exercise your creativity by choosing different colors and styling it differently. However, it should still function as a clock, allowing the user to easily read the time.
