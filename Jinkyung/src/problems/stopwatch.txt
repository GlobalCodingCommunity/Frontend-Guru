Create a React stopwatch component with two input fields: one for minutes and one for seconds. Do not use any min or max attributes on the inputs â€” just plain number inputs. 
The stopwatch should display the time in the format MM:SS and include Start, Pause, and Reset buttons.

Start begins counting down from the entered time.

Pause stops the countdown while keeping the current time.

Reset stops the countdown and returns the stopwatch to the originally entered minutes and seconds.
