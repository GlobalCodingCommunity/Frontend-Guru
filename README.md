# Frontend-Guru Study Group - Technical Interview Prep

A study group focused on **React.js Frontend Technical Interviews**, designed to move beyond algorithmic challenges and focus on practical component implementation, system design, and optimization.

## 🎯 **Goal**

Our primary objective is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. We aim to:
*   Implement complex UI components within strict time constraints.
*   Go beyond "making it work" to discuss and implement **optimizations**, **code structure**, **interaction design**, and **performance**.
*   Develop the ability to handle "real-world" interview scenarios where debugging and interpreting vague requirements are key.

## 📚 **Curriculum**

We utilize resources and problems based on [GreatFrontend.com](https://greatfrontend.com).

## 🗓️ **Structure**

*   **Duration**: 6-week intensive program.
*   **Format**: Weekly assignments and peer-reviewed mock interviews.

### **Tracks**

We offer tailored tracks to suit different experience levels:

| Track | Target Audience | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Senior** | 4+ years (Frontend Engineer II / IC4 / LC4) | **Product Design (Frontend System Design)** + Medium difficulty coding tasks. Option to focus solely on Product Design. |
| **Mid-level** | 1-3 years | **Frontend Coding Interview** focus. Starts with observation, moving to mock interviews as confidence grows. |
| **Auditor** | Juniors / Non-majors | Primarily observation based. Great for learning the interview process without the pressure of leading. |

### **Assignments**

*   **Coding Interview**: 2 problems per week.
*   **Product Design Only**: 1 problem per week.
*   **Hybrid**: 2 Coding problems + 1 Product Design problem (every 2-3 weeks).

*Note: Completion is self-paced, but active participation ensures the best experience for your mock interview partners.*

### **Mock Interviews**

We organize multiple time slots based on participant availability to ensure everyone has the opportunity to practice peer-to-peer interviews.
