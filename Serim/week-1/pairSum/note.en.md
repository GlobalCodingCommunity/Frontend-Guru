## When is a Hash Map a good solution?

- When the problem does not require considering the order of elements  
- When you only need to find two matching values and can stop once you find them  
- When the problem is treated as a combination problem (order does not matter)  
- When using the typical “two-sum pattern” (`target - x`), where order is irrelevant by design
