## WEEK 0
### Why I joined this study group
- To improve my English communication skills in development
- To level up my frontend engineering skills

I recently attended [React Conf 2025](https://conf.react.dev/), and I absolutely loved the atmosphere—people freely discussing what they’re passionate about and sharing ideas openly. However, one thing I regretted was that even though I had many things I wanted to say and ask, my English wasn’t good enough to fully express myself.

Because of that experience, I decided to focus specifically on practical English for development. I want to be able to talk about tech confidently and naturally. I felt that the Frontend Guru study group would help me work toward this goal, so I decided to join.

### What I want to achieve
My goals for this study group are **to complete the entire program** and **to consistently follow the routine I set for myself**. First, I want to participate actively and finish the study without missing sessions.

I also have a weekly routine I want to maintain:
- Solve at least one problem every week
- Re-solve the problems covered during the study session
- Write a review/reflection after each session

I really want to stick to these three habits.

## WEEK 1 (25-11-10 ~ 25-11-16)
- [x] Solve at least one problem this week  
  - [Array.prototype.filter](https://www.greatfrontend.com/interviews/study/three-months/questions/javascript/array-filter)
- [x] Re-solve the problems from the study  
  - [useCounter](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/javascript/use-counter?practice=practice&tab=coding)
  - [Pair sum](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/algo/pair-sum?practice=practice&tab=coding)
- [x] Write a study review

### Review of the 25-11-15 (Sat) study session
**useCounter**
- I liked how the reviewer asked for improvement ideas after finishing the solution.

**Pair sum**
- It was helpful that the person explained their thought process step-by-step while solving the problem.

## WEEK 2 (25-11-17 ~ 25-11-23)

- [x] Solve at least one problem per week
  - [debounce](https://www.greatfrontend.com/interviews/study/three-months/questions/javascript/debounce)

  - [Array.prototype.bind](https://www.greatfrontend.com/interviews/study/three-months/questions/javascript/array-filter)
- [x] Re-solve problems covered in the study group
  - [Smallest element in rotated sorted array](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/algo/array-smallest-in-rotated?practice=practice&tab=coding)
  - [Binary Tree Subtree](https://www.greatfrontend.com/interviews/study/blind75/questions/algo/binary-tree-subtree)
- [x] Study review

### Study Review – Saturday, 25-11-22

**Smallest Element in Rotated Sorted Array**

- Take enough time to analyze the problem thoroughly before starting.

**Binary Tree Subtree**

- Be able to explain why DFS was chosen.
- If stuck while solving, ask questions in a concrete and specific form.
