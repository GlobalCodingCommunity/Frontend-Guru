# Jun's Study Space

Welcome to my personal workspace for the **Frontend-Guru** study group. This repository documents my journey in mastering frontend technical interviews, from component implementation to system design.

## 🎯 **Focus Areas**

My work here concentrates on three key pillars:

*   **Component Architecture**: Building reusable, accessible, and robust UI components.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Exploring techniques like debouncing, throttling, and efficient rendering to ensure smooth user experiences.
*   **System Design**: Designing scalable frontend architectures that can handle complex requirements.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

*   **Core**: React, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Styling**: CSS Modules / Styled Components
*   **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library

## ✨ **Key Highlights**

*   [**Data Table**](./data-table): A comprehensive data table implementation featuring sorting, filtering, and pagination. *Focus: Managing complex state and optimizing render performance.*
*   [**File Explorer**](./file-explorer): A recursive file tree component. *Focus: Recursion and efficient state management for nested structures.*
*   [**Utilities**](./): Implementation of core JavaScript utilities like `deep-clone`, `debounce`, and `flatten` to understand the internal mechanics of popular libraries.
