merge same userIds
Set
first loop
if the user is in set then add to user in the set
when adding user to the existing user from set
add duration, concat equipments
else just add to set
convert set to array and return it

while coding, I realize I should use Map instead since I need to use userId to find the existing user. 

didn't pay attention and read carefully the description: 
Combine all the equipment used, de-duplicating the values and sorting alphabetically.
