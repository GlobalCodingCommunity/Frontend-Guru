# Debounce

- Question: https://www.greatfrontend.com/interviews/study/gfe75/questions/javascript/debounce
- Things I knew before
  - How debounce works
- Things I forgot
  - I forgot to include the context of this, that is, the “this” of the wrapper function.
  - This is needed, just in case the function to be debounced comes from an object method.
